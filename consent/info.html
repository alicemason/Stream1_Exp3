<h1>Information Sheet</h1>
<h2>Developing an integrated model of evaluation and choice</h2>
<p>This project examines how we collect and combine information to support evaluations and judgements.</p>

<p>In the task, you will be shown sequences of values, and will be asked to make one of a number of judgements on those values (e.g., what is the average?). You may also be asked to remember the values by recalling as many values as possible.
All information will be presented on a computer screen, and your responses will be collected using the computer keyboard or the mouse.

<p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and does not prejudice any right to compensation, which you may be entitled to under statute or common law. At any time before or during the experiment you may, without prejudice, withdraw from the study without reason or justification, in which case your data will be destroyed, unless you agree otherwise. Your data will be stored in a non-identified fashion, meaning that no identifying information will be associated with the data we collect from you in the experiment. Accordingly, you will not be able to withdraw your consent for us to use your data once the study has been completed.</p>

<p>On publication of this work, your data (without any personally identifying information) will be made publicly available by banking the data from the entire study on data sharing websites, particularly the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io). This will allow any researchers (including ourselves) to potentially re-use these data by running new analyses to generate new findings, and will allow other researchers to verify our published analyses.</p>
