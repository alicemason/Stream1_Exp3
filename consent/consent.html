<h2>Developing an integrated model of evaluation and choice</h2>
<p>I understand that the purpose of this study is to understand how people encode and retrieve information from memory.</p>
<p>The general procedures of the study have been outlined to me, and I have been informed of the duration of the tasks.</p>
<p>I have read the information provided to me and am satisfied that I understand the nature of the task(s) I am being asked to complete. I understand that my decision to participate in this study is voluntary, and does not prejudice any right to compensation, which I may have under statute or common law.</p>
<p>I understand that I may withdraw at any time before the end of the experimental session without prejudice by closing the browser window. I understand that data already collected at the time of withdrawing will have already been anonymised, and will be retained by the researchers.</p>
<p>I understand the data I provide will be <strong>non-identifiable</strong>. No link will be made between my name or other identifying information and my study data, and I understand that my internet protocol (IP) address will not be stored by the experiment program. I agree that research data gathered for the study may be published but that my name or other identifying information is not used. I understand that in line with the principles of Open Science---which encourages transparency, efficiency and accountability in research---the non-identifiable data from this study will be made publicly available by banking it in an openly accessible data repository. This will allow other researchers to replicate any analyses of the data that are published, and will allow research groups in the University of Western Australia and elsewhere to run new analyses on the data to uncover new findings. The conditions on this form under which I have provided the data will still apply.</p>
