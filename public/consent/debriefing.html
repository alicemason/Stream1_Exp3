<p>Thank you for taking part in our study.</p>

<p>Our project is looking at how people evaluate experiences. Past studies have shown that people tend to give more weighting to the end of an experience when evaluating it: in other words, the last day of a holiday has more effect on our judgements when we think back and determine how much we enjoyed the holiday. We are interested in the idea that this actually a memory effect. In many situations people have better memory for the end of a sequence of information (or an event), and it is possible that this causes people to give more weighting to that information when evaluating experiences.

<p>In the experiment in which you just took part, you were asked to either remember the number bundles, or to evaluate them by making an offer to buy (stating your maximum willingness to pay). Our main analysis will focus on whether memory performance predicts evaluations. In other words, we will look at how well people remembered information at different serial positions in the number bundles, and see how well those memory scores predict people's evaluations on the willingness-to-pay task.

<p>The results will be used to inform the development of a theoretical model. Our goal is to take some contemporary models of memory, and use those to explain people's evaluations and choices, thus providing a more unified framework for understanding memory and decision-making.
