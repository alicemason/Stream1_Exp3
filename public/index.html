Following each bundle of Galactic Credits, you will be asked to perform two tasks. The order in which you perform the tasks will change for each sequence of numbers.',
        'In the "recall" task you will be asked to recall as many of the numbers as possible. Under the message telling you to recall the numbers, there will be a response box. Type the remembered numbers into the response box one by one, pressing enter/return after entering each number. You will have 15 seconds to type in as many numbers as you can remember. You may recall the numbers in any order you choose.',
        'In the "auction" task you will be asked the maximum price you would be willing to pay for the bundle, in Galactic Credits. The estimated value of the entire bundle is simply the average of the numbers in that bundle. Accordingly, if the bundle contained the numbers 10, 20, and 30, the value of the bundle is 20 Galactic Credits (GC). Your task is to set the maximum price you would be willing to pay (in Galactic Credits) for the bundle. You will have 15 seconds to type in your evaluation.',
        'Your evaluation of the number sequences will determine the bonus you are paid at the end of the experiment. In addition to the base payment for the experiment, you will by default be paid a bonus of 100 Galactic Credits (GC). The actual bonus you receive will depend on your evaluation of the sequences, as explained on the next screen.',
        'At the end of the experiment, the computer program will randomly pick one of the number bundles to pay out on. For the selected bundle, we will use a random price method to decide whether or not you actually do buy the bundle. The computer will generate a random selling price for the bundle; note that this selling price isn\'t necessarily the average value (i.e., the computer may over-value or under-value the bundle).<br><br>If your buying offer is higher than this selling price, then you must buy the bundle for the amount chosen by the computer. If this happens, the selling price will be taken away from your bonus, and the value of the bundle (the average of the bundle) will be added to your bonus.<br><br>If your buying offer is lower than the randomly generated selling price, then you keep your bonus and do not get the bundle value.<br><br>Move to the next screen to see an example.',
        'Imagine you saw the sequence {10,20,30}, and you decided to offer X GC for that bundle. The computer randomly generates a selling price of 25 GC. If X was below 25 GC, your offer would be rejected, and your bonus would be 100 GC. If X was above 25 GC, you would pay 25 GC for the bundle, and in return you would receive the average value of the bundle; accordingly, your bonus would be 100 - 25 + 20 = 95 GC.<br><br>Because the price is chosen by the computer at random, it is in your best interest to offer how much you think the bundle is really worth.',
        'At the end of the experiment, your bonus in Galactic Credits will be converted into real money (UK pounds). You will find out the conversion rate at that point; as a guide, the bonus will lie between 0 and 2 pounds. The bonus is contingent on satisfactory completion of the experiment (i.e., legitimate responses entered on all trials), but does not depend on your accuracy on the memory task.',
        'To summarise:<br><br>At the end of each sequence, you will be asked to complete two tasks:<br><br>When you are asked to recall, type in as many numbers from the sequence as you can remember, pressing the return/enter key after each number.<br><br>When you are asked your offering price for the bundle, enter a single number representing the maximum you would be willing to pay for the bundle (in Galactic Credits) and then press the enter key.<br><br>In both tasks, please make sure to press enter after typing each number.<br><br>If you need to review the instructions, please use the Previous button below to navigate back through the instructions. Otherwise, press Next to move to the first bundle of numbers.'
